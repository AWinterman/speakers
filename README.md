# speakers

A repository of Node speakers. A template is
provided to add yourself: simply copy the `template/` directory
to `city-state-country/`, and rename the file to `your-human-name.md`,
and send a pull request.

## audience

This repository is intended primarily for node meetup organizers and
individuals looking to speak at node meetups. The intent is for organizers
to be able to contact local speakers more easily, for speakers to 
be able to share their talks to folks interested in hosting them, and for
speakers to be able to swap notes about what worked well (or not so well!)
in their own talks.

**Please refrain from publishing speaker pages for other people.** If there is
a speaker you particularly enjoyed, contact them (politely!) and encourage them
to submit a PR to this repo.
